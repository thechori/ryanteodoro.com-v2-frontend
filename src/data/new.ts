The audit page allowed users to submit a URL which would fire off an API call to the dedicated backend service (Node.js/Express) which was hosted onsite on an old MacBook Pro via ngrok's tunneling service. This design decision was chosen because the cloud services at providers like DigitalOcean were extremely expensive for servers with powerful CPUs and GPUs which were necessary to run in-depth scans, especially in parallel when multiple scans were requested. This parallelism was made possible using clustering in the `puppeteer-cluster` NPM library. All requests and results were stored to a Postgres DB hosted via Supabase and this information was used for lead generation purposes.",

Configured and managed external systems (e.g., AWS for S3 [storage] and SES [emails], Twilio [SMS/voice calls], Stripe [payment processing], Sentry [error logging], Amplitude [product/user analytics], BetterStack [uptime monitoring]).
Setup Stripe for payment processing to charge customer credit cards via recurring monthly subscriptions using 3 different tiers, as well as free trials to promote user adoption.
Prototyped system to provide on-demand AI-generated call transcriptions using Twilio Intelligence APIs for retrieving sentences from recorded conversations.
Setup Knex.js as PostgreSQL interface using query building, migrations, seeds, and database-driven TypeScript schema generation to ensure database was the applicationâ€™s source of truth for data structures (which cascaded to frontend for end-to-end type safety).
Stood up WordPress website alongside React SPA for marketing and SEO purposes -- achieved #2 spot on Google Search results for target search keyword. Home-baked authentication system which leveraged JWTs.
