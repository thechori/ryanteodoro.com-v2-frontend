            I'm a 3D animator turned software engineer/entrepreneur with a
            passion for digital media. I grew up building computers and playing
            video games and fell in love with the world of software when I was
            forced to learn Java as part of my college curriculum. My favorite
            work is found at the intersection of cutting-edge technology,
            practical decisions, and positive tangible outcomes to my end users.
          </p>

            Currently, I'm founder and CEO at 4ccessible where I specialize in
            the application of AI in the context of digital accessibility. My
            startup was accepted into the startup centers at Google and Amazon
            in Tokyo and was recently announced as an Innovation Award finalist
            for SXSW 2025.

            I've had the opportunity to develop software across nearly all
            industries â€” from big tech (HP) and large corporations (Shell) to
            YC-backed startups (Perl Street [YC W22]), small digital product
            studios, non-profits, and so much more.
